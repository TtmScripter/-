AutoGetIDK There are problems that have not been solved.
Official version:

local Maker = "Ttm"
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TtmScripter/-/main/AutoGetIDK(NinjaLegend)"))()
while wait() do
game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character.HumanoidRootPart.Anchored = Get
end

Fixed the problem that there was no way to move after closing.
